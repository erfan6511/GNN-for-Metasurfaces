# GNN-for-Metasurfaces
The code for the paper "Graph Neural Networks to Model the Coupling between Scattering Elements in Metasurfaces of Varying Sizes".

  - The "dataset" folder contains the code for creating the dataset using Tidy3D.

  - The "Inverse Design" folder contains the code for the inverse design process and for testing it.
  
  - The "Training" folder contains the network model, athe code for training the network, and the code for testing the network with different input polarizations.
